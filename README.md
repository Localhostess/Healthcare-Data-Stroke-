Machine Learning Classifiers Used:
- Logistic Regression
- Gaussian NB

Final prediction for the test data was performed using the Logistic Regression model because it performed better than Gaussian NB

Handling The Imbalanced Dataset: as is common with similar healthcare problems, the stroke dataset was highly imbalanced. To improve the model, random oversampling was used..
